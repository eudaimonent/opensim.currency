0. Outline

 This Money Server is modified version of DTL Currency Processing (http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/currency/).
 As for this, some bug fixes are done. And this can be operated by OpenSim 0.7.x. 
 But, WEB Monitor function (ASP.NET) is removed from original DTL Currency. So, this version is less secure than original 
 version!! Please use this at your own risk!!



1. Install

 # cd opensim-0.7.x-source
 # tar xzfv opensim.currency-0.7.x.tar.gz 
 # patch -p1 < opensim.currency-0.7.x/opensim_currency_0.7.x.patch
 # ./runprebuild.sh && nant clean && nant
 # cd opensim.currency-0.7.x
 # ./build.sh



2. Setting

2-1. Money Server

 # cd opensim-0.7.x-source
 # vi bin/MoneyServer.ini 

  - Plese set hostname, database, username and password of MySQL at [MySql] section.
  - If you use Banker Avatar, please set UUID of Banker Avatar to "BankerAvatar" in MoneyServer.ini.
    Banker Avatar can buy money from system with no cost.
	When 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 is specified as UUID, all avatars can get money from system.
  - If you want to normally use llGiveMoney() function even when payer doesn't login to Opensim,
	you must set "true" to "enableForceTransfer" in MoneyServer.ini.


2-2. Region Server

 # cd opensim-0.7.x-source
 # vi bin/OpenSim.ini

   EconomyModule  = DTLMoneyModule
   UserServer = "http://(MoneyServer's Name or IP):8003/"

 Attention) 
   Not use 127.0.0.1 or localhost for UserServer's address. This address is used for 
   identification of user on Money Server.


2-3. Helper Script

  - If you do not use XoopenSim or Modlos (WEB Interface), you should setup helper scripts by manual.
  - Please copy Scripts/* to any WEB contents directory, and edit ENV_HELPER_URL, ENV_HELPER_PATH and DB information
    in include/config.php 

 ex.)
 # mkdir /var/www/html/currency
 # cp -R Scripts/* /var/www/html/currency
 # cd /var/www/html/currency
 # chown -R apache.apache .
 # vi include/config.php

  - Please execute viewer with "-helperuri [ENV_HELPER_URL/]" option. (need last '/' ex. -loginuri http://localhost/currency/helper/)
    Here, ENV_HELPER_URL is helper directory url in include/config.php.
