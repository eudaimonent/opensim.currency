0. Outline

  This Money Server is modified version of DTL Currency Processing (http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/currency/).
As for this, some bug fixes are done. And this can be operated by OpenSim 0.6.7. 
  But, WEB Monitor function (ASP.NET) is removed from original DTL Currency. So, this version is less secure than original 
version!! Please use this at your own risk!!
