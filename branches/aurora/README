0. Outline

 This Money Server is modified version of DTL Currency Processing (http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/currency/).
 As for this, some bug fixes are done. And this can be operated by Aurora-Sim 0.4.x. 
 But, WEB Monitor function (ASP.NET) is removed from original DTL Currency. So, this version is less secure than original 
 version!! Please use this at your own risk!!



1. Install

 # git clone git://github.com/MatrixSmythe/Aurora.git aurora
 # cd aurora
 # svn co http://www.nsl.tuis.ac.jp/svn/opensim/opensim.currency/branches/aurora aurora.currency
 # patch -p1 < aurora.currency/aurora_currency_latest.patch
 # ./runprebuild.sh && xbuild
 # cd aurora.currency
 # ./build.sh
 # cd ../bin
 # vi MoneyServer.ini       (modify [MySql] section)



2. Setting

2-1. Money Server

 # cd aurora/bin
 # vi MoneyServer.ini 

  - Plese set hostname, database, username and password of MySQL at [MySql] section.
  - If you want to normally use llGiveMoney() function even when payer doesn't login to Aurora-Sim,
	you must set "true" to enableForceTransfer in MoneyServer.ini.


2-2. Region Server

 # cd aurora/bin/Configuration/Modules
 # cp Economy.ini.example Economy.ini
