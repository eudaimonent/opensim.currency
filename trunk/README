0. Outline

 This Money Server is modified version of DTL Currency Processing (http://forge.opensimulator.org/gf/project/currency/).
 As for this, some bug fixes and some functionality expansions are done. And this can be operated by OpenSim 0.7.x. 
 But, Web Monitor function (ASP.NET) is removed from original DTL Currency. So, this version is less secure than original 
 version!! Please use this at Your Own Risk!!
